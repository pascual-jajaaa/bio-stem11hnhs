        <h1>Types of Connective Tissues</h1>
        <p>Connective tissues are essential components of the body that provide support, bind together, and protect tissues and organs. They are classified into three main types: connective tissue proper, supportive connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="ctp">Connective Tissue Proper</h3>
            <p>Connective tissue proper includes both loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="2-1_lct.html">Loose Connective Tissue</a>:</b> Has a higher amount of ground substance compared to fibers. It is found in the skin, around blood vessels, and in organs. It provides cushioning and support, allows for nutrient diffusion, and plays a role in immune response.</li>
                <li><b><a href="2-2_dct.html">Dense Connective Tissue</a>:</b> Has a higher amount of fibers compared to ground substance. It is found in tendons, ligaments, and the dermis of the skin. It provides strong, flexible support and resistance to tension.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Function:</b> Absorbs shock, binds tissues together, provides structural support, flexibility, and protection to organs and tissues.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="sct"><a href="2-3_sct.html">Supportive Connective Tissue</a></h3>
            <p>Supportive connective tissue provides strength, structure, and support to the body. It includes bone and cartilage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bone:</b> A rigid connective tissue that forms the skeleton. It supports and protects organs, facilitates movement, stores minerals, and houses bone marrow for blood cell production.</li>
                <li><b>Cartilage:</b> A flexible connective tissue found in joints, the rib cage, ear, nose, bronchial tubes, and intervertebral discs. It provides smooth surfaces for joint movement, structural support, and cushioning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Function:</b> Provides firmness, support, and structural integrity to the body, particularly in bone and cartilage.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="fct"><a href="2-4_fct.html">Fluid Connective Tissue</a></h3>
            <p>Fluid connective tissue has a liquid extracellular matrix and functions in transport, immunity, and homeostasis. It includes blood and lymph.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Blood:</b> A fluid connective tissue that circulates through the cardiovascular system. It transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products, and plays a role in immune response and regulation of body temperature.</li>
                <li><b>Lymph:</b> A fluid connective tissue that circulates through the lymphatic system. It helps in the removal of toxins and waste, transports white blood cells, and supports immune function.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Function:</b> Transports nutrients, gases, and waste products, supports immune function, and maintains homeostasis.</p>
