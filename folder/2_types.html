            <h3>Connective Tissue Proper</h3>
            <p>Includes both loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue.
            <br /><a href="" target="_parent">Loose connective tissue</a> has a higher amount of ground tissue as compared to fibers.
            <br /><a href="" target="_parent">Dense connective tissue</a> has higher amount of fibers compared to ground tissue.
            <br /><b>Function:</b> absorbs shock and binds tissue together.
            <br />Provides structural support, flexibility, and protection to organs and tissues.</p>

            <h3>Supportive Connective Tissue</h3>
            <p>Supportive connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that provides strength, structure, and support to the body. It has a firm extracellular matrix that helps maintain the shape of organs and protects delicate structures.
            <br /><b>Function:</b> provides firmness, support, and structural integrity to the body, particularly in bone and cartilage.</p>

            <h3>Fluid Connective Tissue</h3>
            <p>Fluid connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that has a liquid extracellular matrix and functions in transport, immunity, and homeostasis.
            <br /><b>Function:</b> Provides firmness, support, and structural integrity to the body, particularly in bone and cartilage.</p>
