        <p>Loose Connective Tissue is a cellular connective tissue with thin and relatively sparse collagen fibers. They have a semi-fluid matrix with lesser proportions of fibers. Its ground substance occupies more volume than the fibers do. It has a viscous to gel-like consistency and plays an important role in the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from the capillaries that course through this connective tissue as well as in the diffusion of carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes back to the vessels.</p>
        <p><b>Location</b>: between organs, muscles, blood vessels, glands, skin.    
            <br><b>Structure</b>: collagen fibers far apart.
            <br><b>Function</b>: support and protection</p>

            <ul>
                <li>primarily beneath epithelial tissues, surrounding organs, nerves, and blood vessels, and between muscles.</li>
                <li>made of collagen fibers and elastic fibers, no reticular fiber</li>
                <li>function: structural support, medium for diffusion, movement and immune system.</li>

                    branching fibers made of collagen type III.</li>
                <li>reticular fibers form a network or meshwork (stroma) that
                    provides structural support for various organs and tissues
                    in the body.</li>
